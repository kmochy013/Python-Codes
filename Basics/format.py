# To use formatting in string we have to use 'f' before the double quotation in print function and also we have to use curly bracket there is an example:

num1 = 20
num2 = 50

print(f"This is my super Number {num1 + num2}")

name = "Kamrul "
Roll = 10

print(f"My name is {name} and my roll is {Roll}")
